        <h2>Plagiarism</h2>
        <p>Plagiarism is the act of using someone else's work, ideas, or intellectual property without proper acknowledgment or permission. In the digital age, where information is readily accessible, plagiarism has become an increasingly prevalent issue in academic, professional, and creative fields.</p>
        <p>It can take various forms, from copying text directly to using someone else’s images, research, or ideas without giving credit. Plagiarism undermines the value of original work, violates ethical standards, and can lead to serious consequences, including legal actions and damage to one’s reputation.</p>
        <p> Understanding the importance of originality and proper citation is crucial in maintaining integrity in any form of communication or creation.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Legal aspects</h3>
        <p>Although plagiarism in some contexts is considered theft or stealing, the concept does not exist in a legal sense. The use of someone else's work in order to gain academic credit may however meet some legal definitions of fraud. "Plagiarism" specifically is not mentioned in any current statute, either criminal or civil. Some cases may be treated as unfair competition or a violation of the doctrine of moral rights. In short, people are asked to use the guideline, "if you did not write it yourself; you must give credit".</p>
        <p>Plagiarism is also considered a moral offense against anyone who has provided the plagiarist with a benefit in exchange for what is specifically supposed to be original content (for example, the plagiarist's publisher, employer, or teacher). In such cases, acts of plagiarism may sometimes also form part of a claim for breach of the plagiarist's contract, or, if done knowingly, for a civil wrong. </p>
        <h3>Cases Of Plagiarism</h3>
        <p>Several cases of plagiarism have been reported in recent years, including:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Jayson Blair (2003) – A New York Times journalist, Blair was caught fabricating stories and plagiarizing content from other news outlets, leading to his resignation.</li>
            <li>Fareed Zakaria (2012) – CNN host and journalist was accused of plagiarizing sections of an article for The New Yorker.</li>
            <li>Melania Trump (2016) – During her RNC speech, parts of her speech were found to have been lifted from Michelle Obama's 2008 address.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Reverse plagiarism</h2>
        <p>Reverse plagiarism, or attribution without copying, refers to falsely giving authorship credit over a work to a person who did not author it, or falsely claiming a source supports an assertion that the source does not make. Although both the term and activity are relatively rare, incidents of reverse plagiarism do occur typically in similar contexts as traditional plagiarism.</p>
        <h3>Impact of artificial intelligence</h3>
        <p>The increase in plagiarism can also be attributed to developments in artificial intelligence. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 and ChatGPT raised global discussion about the impact of artificial intelligence on writing and plagiarism. One such innovation is the GPT-2 model, which is capable of generating coherent paragraphs and achieving high scores on various language modeling assessments. It can also perform basic tasks such as reading comprehension, machine translation, question answering, and summarization. Currently, detectors of AI language such as GPTZero have been introduced to cope with this problem. Noam Chomsky called ChatGPT "nothing more than high-tech plagiarism". In contrast, others have proposed that "the essay is dead", declaring that artificial intelligence will transform academia and society. One scholar of plagiarism, Eaton, proposed the idea of a postplagiarism era, in which human and artificial-intelligence hybrid writing become normal. The impact of artificial intelligence on plagiarism has yet to be fully understood. </p>
        <P>The widespread use of artificial intelligence creates trouble for colleges. With ChatGPT's strong database and convenience, students who see much of the work assigned by professors as just busywork will complete the work via artificial intelligence. However, instead of banning the use of ChatGPT in academic study, some have suggested that professors use tools like ChatGPT in their teaching to create outlines, individualized lesson plans, and ideas for classroom activities.</P>
